一、互联网金融理财产品发展现状及优势 
（一）互联网金融理财产品发展现状 
在 20 世纪末期最早意义的互联网金融开始诞生，美国的三家银行与一家计算机公司一起成立的纯网络银行 SFNB，为互联网金融的产生和 成长铺设了道路，提供了雏形。当今互联网金融 经过强势萌发，已经逐步从粗放型转为注重质量的健康发展的模式，互联网金融理财足不出户的理财方式大大方便了人们的日常生活，使互联网金融理财能够迅速地普及。互联网金融理财种类越来越丰富，用户迅速增长，将一种新的理财思想注入给了投资者，慢慢地替代了我们传统的理财习惯，成为一种新的潮流。伴随着互联网金融监管体系与风险管理系统逐步完善，这 是对传统银行业理财产品发展的一项挑战。 目前，我国互联网金融市场以 P2P、第三方 支付和类似余额宝的基金理财最为盛行。虽然互联网金融理财产品进入大众视野中时间并不长，但却有极强的延伸性。在短短几年内，众多公司就衍生出了上千款类似的产品，如腾讯的理财宝，苏宁云商的零钱宝，P2P类下的真鑫贷等。余额宝在2013 年 6 月 17 日上线后推出的18 天后用户就突破 250 万，一个月募集到上百亿资金。2018 年第四季度第三方支付移动支付 市场交易规模达 47.2 万亿元人民币，环比升高 7.78%。由此看出，互联网金融的确是经济发展 中不可忽略的一部分。 较低的成本，操作的便捷，涉及范围的广 泛，使互联网金融逐步被人们认可，拥有了较多客户。但是我们也要看见互联网金融理财虽然 一直在完善，但是其管理依旧较弱，容易引发信 用和网络安全等方面的问题，从 2017 年开始， 余额宝已经进行了四次调整，监管机构也对余 额宝等理财产品在市场上的流通进行讨论，限 额限购政策使其发展减缓，T+0 快速赎回业务 等一系列变化也会影响其未来发展，所以我们 要辩证看待互联网金融理财。 （二）互联网金融理财的优势 1.起存金额低，门槛低。传统银行业理财产 品起存金额至少为 5 万元，严格的风险评级并 受制于国家相关政策，极大地削弱了银行理财 产品的流动性，而法律上对互联网金融理财产 品没有明确的管制，因此在起存金额，门槛方面 的要求相对较低。比如余额宝起存金额可以从 1 元起存，按天结算收益率，随转随取，也通过 与网上消费挂钩对客户进行信用评级，这大大 方便了中小企业以及个人投资者进行理财，而 银行理财的高要求大大限制了中小投资者和潜 在的客户的进入。余额宝这类产品是一款以低 成本获得较高收益的符合大众需要的产品。 2. 操作方便。互联网金融理财产品与手机 软件关联，方便资金转出转入，方便网络购物， 为大家生活提供了极大便利。比如余额宝依附 于支付宝，我们能用其中资金随时购买商品或解 决我们面临一些紧急用资金的事件，钱不仅可以 即时到账，还能将闲置的钱转入理财产品。手机 伴随我们生活也就相当于余额宝一直在我们身 边。而银行理财产品一般是不能提前支取的，如 果非要提前支取，我们自身还会面临一定的损 失，虽然目前部分银行理财可以网上操作，但相 比于互联网理财产品，一些功能还需要提升。 3. 客户来源优势。一般互联网金融理财产 品都来源于一些知名的企业，企业本身就带有 一种宣传，推出时就被大众所了解并接受，增长 快也是情理之中。比如余额宝与支付宝，淘宝合作，本身支付宝和淘宝就有大量的客户，2018 年第四季度支付宝在第三方支付市场占据了 53.78%，全球用户超过十亿，第三方支付中网络 购物占了不可替代的比例，并且客户群体年龄 比较年轻，容易接受新鲜事物，也是有较大投资 理财的需求的群体。以上综合起来，就促使余额 宝迅速发展。还有一点就是在余额宝之前，支付 宝已经拥有较好的口碑和知名度，得到大众的 信任，也是促使余额宝迅速成长的一个原因。 总的来说，互联网金融理财产品是准确抓 住了机会，运用了现代先进的技术，推出了符合 当代需求的产品，认识到了理财中部分被忽视 的群体。从客户本身出发，有较强的针对性，符 合时代潮流，体现了创新主题。 二、实例分析：余额宝对商业银行理财产品 的冲击 （一）分流银行理财产品的资金 1.余额宝产品吸收资金情况。通过表 1 我 们可以看出，余额宝吸收资金一直是呈增长的 趋势，但是由于蚂蚁金服旗下余额宝陆续接入 其他货币基金导致 2018 年余额宝产品筹集资 金略有下降，但人们对余额宝的信任度依然很 高，这是对余额宝的一种认可。余额宝成功的吸 收了市场上一部分资金。
2. 银行理财产品资金情况。通过表 2 银行 理财筹集的资金金额来看，银行理财的筹集资 金也是呈增长趋势，但 2018 年受资管新规，理 财新规等监管政策的影响，银行同业理财规模 萎缩，导致了 2018 年理财筹集资金有所降低。但 是面对强大的群体和有着固定的客户资源的银 行来说，这些增长在其总体来说并不是很大的一 部分，并且同业理财占银行理财中很大比例。银行理财产品 筹集资金的增长速度则越来越慢，说明银行理 财在这些年发展筹集资金过程中，客户对其投 入资金的增长速度减缓，尤其当简便快捷，方便 操作的余额宝出现后，对其更是一个极大的冲 击。2018 年，资管新规的出台，加强了金融行业 的严监管，规范了金融产品的交易，对理财产品 详细规范，同业的理财缩减更对银行产生不小 的冲击。任何行业的存在都离不开客户，客户为行 业发展提供了动力，客户的资金是维持企业发 展的根本，商业银行理财业务是根据客户自身 情况来提供一种适合客户资产增值的产品，这 种投资有利于满足客户本身的财务需求达到自 己的期望。然而随着大数据、云计算等先进技术 在生活中的应用，互联网金融理财产品以其较 低的投资要求、方便快捷的投资方式、灵活的转 入转出方式吸引了一大批客户，银行理财不再 是人们理财中的唯一选择。余额宝不仅仅吸引 了原有在银行理财的客户的资金，还吸收了由 于资金有限想要投资但一直没有进行银行理财 的客户资金，极大地满足了客户的需要。
（二）影响银行理财在市场中的地位 我国商业银行一直是中国金融行业的重要 组成部分。在一定程度上银行在金融行业处于 垄断地位。但是“余额宝”等互联网金融理财产 品的收益一般是要高于银行，这动摇了银行的 垄断地位。互联网公司通过互联网和金融的结 合使金融部门不得不调整和革新其政策和机 构，互联网金融理财产品的出现对商业银行理 财业务快速持续的发展形成一定的阻碍。支付 宝公司与天弘基金公司合作推出余额宝，一定 程度上剥夺了商业银行的理财业务利润。余额 宝的出现让投资者的投资更加多样化，丰富了 客户自身的选择，撼动了银行理财业务在金融 市场上的地位。除此之外，余额宝等金融理财产 品的出现也舒缓了中小企业融资困难的情况。 余额宝的发展及政府和人民的认同在一定程度 上折射出我国加快金融服务业改革和开放的决 心，激励和促使互联网金融创新，减少商业银行 在一些业务的短缺，是我国金融面向民间资本 的丰碑。所以，余额宝等互联网金融理财产品的 出现对商业银行理财业务在金融市场的地位构 成了一定的威胁，降低其市场占比。 （三）降低了现金存款在理财产品中的占比 从图 3 我们可以看出，从 2013 年以后，现 金存款在理财产品中占比迅速下降，五年内从 25%下降到 5%，银行业务主要来源就是吸收存 款发放贷款来从中赚取利差，现金存款的大幅 度下降对银行收益会产生较大的影响。随着余 额宝类理财产品的推出，人们将一部分闲置资 金放入了能获取更高的收益的余额宝中，不再 以现金形式来存放在银行去获取活期存款或者 定期存款的利息。余额宝七日年化收益率在 2.5%～3%之间，还能随用随取，而我国 2019 年 4 月三年定期存款利率在 2.75%左右，活期存款 利率更低，所以余额宝的出现，让人们以现金存 款方式进行理财的比例大大降低。 三、商业银行理财产品应对互联网冲击的 对策 （一）优化产品 1.设计较高收益理财产品 传统商业银行理财产品想要吸引客户首先要提 高金融理财产品的收益，在高质量的风险管理 下，较高的收益率会更加吸引客户。根据对投资者心理研究，在相同收益率下，投资者倾向具有 较大保障的投资，而在相同风险下，投资者倾向 较大收益率。所以，传统银行理财产品在保证风 险一定的情况下可适当提升身收益率，增强自 身竞争力。还可以调整现在发行的理财产品的 结构，将高风险高收益的产品与固定收益产品 进行合理的结合，以此来提高收益，降低风险。 中银活期宝和工银薪金宝都是由银行和基 金公司联合推出的类似余额宝的理财产品，银 行的推出的类余额宝理财产品和余额宝有相似 的高收益。目前大量银行推出这类产品有利于 顺应时代需求，阻止宝宝类产品抢夺银行客户 资源和资金。 2. 与互联网金融结合。现如今互联网普及 十分广泛，银行也要与时俱进，不断开拓，银行 理财产品虽多，但是大体相同，除了收益方面略 有差别，总体来说没有什么创新点，没有新颖的 产品推出就会导致市场份额的流失，银行只有 紧跟时代脚步才不会被淘汰。① 目前，已经有部 分银行推出了类似于余额宝的业务，如平安银 行推出了平安盈，中国银行的活期宝等，银行应 不断完善自身的体系，普及类余额宝业务在银 行的发展，有针对性地甚至一对一地推出符合 客户需求的理财产品，完善服务，升级设备。例 如，与电商合作推出理财产品并加强宣传或者 开发手机 app，提供一系类便捷的咨询等服务， 以此来适应这个快节奏的社会。 3. 降低银行理财门槛。银行高门槛，严监 管，极大地减少了理财的风险，但却阻挡了中小 投资者成为其客户。现在，中小企业在市场上占 有越来越大的比例，他们的潜力也是巨大的，尤 其近些年来，国家一直在强调中小企业的发展， 可见他们在未来地位将会越来越重要。目前也 有大部分个人投资者，由于银行的高门槛不敢尝试理财。所以，银行要想发展更好，就必须照 顾到未来的“潜力股”，因此，银行要相应地降低 门槛。互联网金融能利用大数据，云计算等通过 用户网上消费情况，得出客户信用评级，银行可 以和其合作，得出更完善的信用评级体系、更全 面的了解客户，健全自身监管机制，在低门槛同 时确保收益，提升自己在社会认可度，国家可以 根据现实情况提出相关政策，根据需要来实行 相关政策，灵活执行法律法规和政策，促使银行 更具竞争力。
由以上看出，“宝宝类”理财产品也已经进 入银行，降低了认购金额，缩短了提现时间，吸 引客户和资金，是互联网金融催生的产物。上面 产品顺应当今时代发展，银行已经看到了传统 银行理财产品的不足且正在改善并弥补缺点， 但目前所做的远远不够。 （二）提升服务 1. 简化操作流程。繁琐的操作流程，使大家 对银行理财的抱怨较多。在这个快节奏时代，人 们争分夺秒地工作生活，所以，传统银行理财业 务甚至要去柜台排队办理业务，这显然不适合当 今社会，银行可以简化部分不必要的操作流程。 不仅如此，还可以请技术人员开发研制，运用大 数据云计算等先进的成熟技术，让人们足不出户 享受更加完善的服务。简单的操作流程不仅仅能保留原有的客户资源，节省工作人员的时间，同 时也可以让年龄较大的人尝试理财，简单的流程 让他们更容易学习，提升银行在客户中的好感， 获得认同感，提升银行的形象。 2. 完善银行理财业务体系。2018 年被称为 资管元年，资管行业迎来统一监管时期。该规 定树立了统一监管标准，最大限度实现公平， 极大缩小监管套利空间，促进资产管理业务健 康发展。 好的银行理财业务体系是确保低理财风险 的必要条件，大部分在银行进行理财的人是看 中银行的完善的体系，有较大的保障。所以，首 先银行可以根据客户需求进行针对性服务，建 立完善的有效的服务评价体系，将服务落实到 实处，改变传统的电话推销，短信营销等方式， 可以建立一套服务体系，定制适合客户自己的 理财产品。如果银行继续完善业务体系，不仅确 保收益，还根据当今时代发展趋势进行创新，将 大大提升银行理财在人们心中的地位。再次还 可以开发捆绑式销售的策略来带动银行理财产 品的销售。然后，银行还要加强对工作人员的教 育，充实其自身，了解理财，以客户为工作中心， 获得客户信任。根据统计，银行的基金销售平台 还没有完全建立起来，所以银行还要设立网点 销售基金等理财产品。我们一直处在一个的发 展的前进的社会，只有越来越完善的自己，紧跟 时代的步伐，才不会被社会所淘汰。 （三）确保收益 收益的保障主要是通过加强理财产品风险 控制。余额宝等互联网金融理财产品虽然成长 快速，但是风险的控制还是很欠缺的，这是人们 在理财时候会考虑的一个重要问题，这也是使 互联网金融理财大部分客户是小资金理财的原 因。互联网金融理财产品近几年一直在风险控 制方面进行努力，提升自己竞争力。为此银行也 要提升自己，保持自己的优势，银行可以引进精 通计算机与金融的混合型人才，利用大数据、云 计算等技术对金融风险监管和控制，开发并研 究相关软件，降低风险。 四、对商业银行理财产品未来的展望 商业银行理财产品在一定程度上受到互联 网金融理财产品的影响，分流了一部分商业银 行理财产品的客户资金，相应的会带走银行理财的一些潜在客户，影响商业理财产品在市场 理财产品中的占比，对商业银行理财业务形成 了一种无形的压力。但是，同时我们也发现了商 业银行理财发展比互联网金融成熟得多，在理 财产品中不可完全被替代。团贷网事件就提示 了我们互联网金融平台依旧存在较大漏洞，信 用化、专业化方面仍低于银行。商业银行理财更 容易吸收较大的理财金额。虽然互联网金融理 财加大了风险监控力度，提升自己信誉度，让客 户有所保障，但是在这些方面还是不如银行的， 而且银行的人力、物力和财力，最重要的还有国 家的保障，是互联网金融理财很长一段时间内 不能达到的。面临科技的发展，互联网金融理财 产品的影响力不能掉以轻心，但只要银行能紧 跟时代步伐，引进人才，优化发展创新型金融理 财产品，在操作门槛相关较弱势的方面进行提 升，在风险监管等优势方面不断提升短板，优化 长板来提升自己竞争力，相信银行理财产品依 旧会在市场中处于领先地位。目前，国家正一步 步规范互联网金融理财的发展，其规模不会扩 大甚至有可能减小，发展速度也会放缓，从高速 度向高质量发展，这无疑对于银行来说是一个 重大的利好政策，银行要把握时机迅速发展自 身理财业务，我认为商业银行理财产品不会完 全被互联网金融理财产品替代，但是如果不完 善银行体系，其在市场中所占比重将会严重萎 缩。不断更新银行理财产品，将易操作、低风险、 较高的收益以及安全保障等集于一身，获得大 众认可，树立自身形象，这样才能引领理财的时 代潮流，不被时代所淘汰。
1. The development status and advantages of Internet financial wealth management products (I) The development status of Internet financial wealth management products began to emerge at the end of the 20th century. The earliest Internet finance was born. The pure Internet bank SFNB established by three US banks and a computer company is the The emergence and growth of paved the way and provided a prototype. Nowadays, Internet finance has been vigorously germinated, and it has gradually shifted from an extensive model to a healthy development model that emphasizes quality. The financial management method of Internet finance without leaving home greatly facilitates people's daily life and enables the rapid popularization of Internet finance. The types of Internet financial management are becoming more and more abundant, and users are growing rapidly. A new financial management idea has been injected into investors, slowly replacing our traditional financial management habits and becoming a new trend. With the gradual improvement of the Internet financial supervision system and risk management system, this is a challenge to the development of traditional banking wealth management products. At present, P2P, third-party payment and similar Yubao funds are the most prevalent in China's Internet financial market. Although Internet finance products have not been in the public eye for a long time, they are extremely extensible. In just a few years, many companies have spawned thousands of similar products, such as Tencent's wealth management treasure, Suning Yunshang's change coin, and P2P-based Zhenxin loan. Yuyuebao broke through 2.5 million users 18 days after its launch on June 17, 2013, and raised tens of billions of funds in a month. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the transaction volume of the third-party payment mobile payment market reached 47.2 trillion yuan, up 7.78% from the previous month. It can be seen from this that Internet finance is indeed an indispensable part of economic development. The low cost, convenient operation, and wide range of coverage have made Internet finance gradually recognized by people and have more customers. However, we must also see that although Internet financial management has been improving, its management is still weak, and it is easy to cause problems in credit and network security. Since 2017, Yu'ebao has made four adjustments, and the regulator has also adjusted the balance. Discussion on the circulation of wealth management products such as Bao in the market, the policy of limit and purchase restrictions slowed down its development, and a series of changes such as T + 0 fast redemption business will also affect its future development, so we have to dialectically view Internet financial wealth management. (2) Advantages of Internet financial management 1. Low deposit amount and low threshold. The deposit amount of traditional banking wealth management products is at least 50,000 yuan. Strict risk rating and subject to relevant national policies have greatly weakened the liquidity of banking wealth management products. There is no clear regulation on Internet financial wealth management products in law, so The threshold for the deposit amount is relatively low. For example, the balance of Yu'ebao can be deposited from 1 yuan, the daily rate of return is settled, and the transfer is taken as soon as possible. It is also linked to online consumption to rate customers' credit ratings, which greatly facilitates financial management for SMEs and individual investors. The high requirements of bank financing have greatly restricted the entry of small and medium investors and potential customers. Products such as Yu'ebao are a product that meets the needs of the public at a low cost to obtain higher returns. 2. Easy operation. Internet financial management products are associated with mobile phone software, which facilitates the transfer of funds in and out, and facilitates online shopping, providing great convenience for everyone's life. For example, Yu'ebao is attached to Alipay, and we can use the funds to buy commodities at any time or to resolve some of the emergencies we face. Not only can money be instantly received, but idle money can also be transferred to financial products. The mobile phone that accompanies us in life means that Yu'ebao has always been with us. Bank wealth management products generally cannot be withdrawn in advance. If we have to withdraw in advance, we will also face certain losses. Although some bank wealth management can be operated online, some functions need to be improved compared to Internet wealth management products. 3. Customer source advantage. Generally, Internet financial management products come from some well-known enterprises. The enterprises themselves carry a kind of publicity, which is understood and accepted by the public when they are launched. The rapid growth is also reasonable. For example, Yubao and Alipay cooperate with Taobao. Alipay and Taobao itself have a large number of customers. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Alipay accounted for 53.78% of the third-party payment market, with more than one billion users worldwide. Online shopping accounted for a significant part of third-party payment. The replacement ratio, and the customer group is relatively young, easy to accept new things, is also a group with greater investment and financial needs. Taken together, the above promotes the rapid development of Yu'ebao. Another point is that before Yubao, Alipay already had a good reputation and popularity, and was trusted by the public, which was also a reason for the rapid growth of Yubao. In general, Internet financial wealth management products accurately capture opportunities, use modern and advanced technologies, launch products that meet contemporary needs, and recognize some of the neglected groups in wealth management. Starting from the customer itself, it has a strong pertinence, conforms to the trend of the times, and embodies the theme of innovation. 2. Case analysis: the impact of Yu'ebao on wealth management products of commercial banks (1) Distributing funds from bank's wealth management products 1. Yuyubao's absorption of funds. From Table 1, we can see that the absorption of funds by Yu'ebao has been on an increasing trend, but due to the successive access of Yu'ebao under Ant Financial to other currency funds, the funds raised by Yu'ebao's products declined slightly in 2018. The level of trust is still very high, which is a recognition of Yu'ebao. Yu'ebao successfully absorbed some of the funds in the market.
Funds of bank wealth management products. According to the amount of funds raised by bank wealth management in Table 2, the amount of funds raised by bank wealth management is also showing an increasing trend. Financing funds raised have decreased. However, in the face of strong groups and banks with fixed customer resources, these growths are not a large part of their overall performance, and inter-bank wealth management accounts for a large proportion of bank wealth management. The growth rate of funds raised by bank wealth management products is getting slower and slower, indicating that during the process of bank financing development in these years, the growth rate of funds invested by customers has slowed down, especially when the simple and fast, easy-to-operate Yu Bao has appeared It is a great impact. In 2018, the introduction of new regulations on asset management strengthened the strict supervision of the financial industry, regulated the trading of financial products, and regulated financial products in detail. The reduction of financial management in the same industry also had a significant impact on banks. The existence of any industry is inseparable from customers. Customers provide impetus for the development of the industry. The customer ’s funds are the foundation for maintaining the development of the enterprise. The financial management business of commercial banks is to provide a product suitable for the appreciation of customer assets according to the customer ’s own situation. Investment is conducive to meeting the financial needs of customers themselves to meet their expectations. However, with the application of big data, cloud computing and other advanced technologies in life, Internet financial wealth management products have attracted a large number of customers with their lower investment requirements, convenient and fast investment methods, and flexible transfer-in and transfer-out methods. It is no longer the only choice in people's financial management. Yu'ebao not only attracted the funds of customers who were originally in the bank's wealth management, but also absorbed the funds of customers who wanted to invest because of limited funds but had never conducted bank wealth management, which greatly satisfied the needs of customers.
Affecting the position of bank wealth management in the market China's commercial banks have always been an important part of China's financial industry. To a certain extent, banks are in a monopoly position in the financial industry. However, the income of Internet financial management products such as "Yuebao" is generally higher than that of banks, which has shaken the monopoly of banks. The combination of Internet companies and the Internet has forced the financial sector to adjust and innovate its policies and institutions. The emergence of Internet financial wealth management products has hindered the rapid and sustained development of the wealth management business of commercial banks. Alipay Co., Ltd. and Tianhong Fund Co., Ltd. launched Yuyuebao, to a certain extent, depriving commercial banks of their wealth management business profits. The appearance of Yu'ebao has made investors 'investment more diversified, enriched customers' own choices, and shaken the status of bank wealth management business in the financial market. In addition, the appearance of financial assets such as Yu'ebao has also eased the financing difficulties of SMEs. The development of Yu'ebao and the recognition of the government and people reflect to a certain extent China's determination to accelerate the reform and opening of the financial services industry, encourage and promote Internet financial innovation, and reduce the shortage of commercial banks in some businesses. monument. Therefore, the emergence of Internet financial management products such as Yu'ebao poses a certain threat to the position of commercial banks' wealth management business in the financial market, reducing their market share. (3) Reduced the proportion of cash deposits in wealth management products. From Figure 3, we can see that after 2013, the proportion of cash deposits in wealth management products declined rapidly, from 25% to 5% within five years. The main source is to absorb deposits and make loans to earn interest spreads, and a large decline in cash deposits will have a greater impact on bank earnings. With the introduction of surplus treasure-type wealth management products, people put part of their idle funds into the balance treasure, which can obtain higher returns, and no longer deposit them in banks in cash to obtain interest on demand deposits or time deposits. Yu'ebao's seven-year annualized return rate is between 2.5% and 3%, and it can be used as needed. However, China's April 2019 three-year fixed deposit interest rate is about 2.75%, and the current deposit interest rate is lower. The emergence has greatly reduced the proportion of people using cash deposits for financial management. 3. The countermeasures of commercial bank wealth management products to deal with the impact of the Internet (1) Optimized products 1. Designing higher-yield wealth management products Traditional commercial bank wealth management products want to attract customers. First, they must increase the income of financial wealth management products. Under high-quality risk management, Higher profitability will attract customers more. According to the psychological research of investors, under the same rate of return, investors tend to invest with greater protection, while under the same risk, investors tend to have a greater rate of return. Therefore, traditional bank wealth management products can appropriately increase their profitability and enhance their own competitiveness under certain circumstances with guaranteed risks. It is also possible to adjust the structure of the wealth management products currently issued and to combine high-risk and high-yield products with fixed-income products in a reasonable way to increase returns and reduce risks. Both BOC Current Account Bao and ICBC Salary Camp are jointly launched by banks and fund companies and are similar to Yu'e Bao's wealth management products. Bank-like Yu'e Bao's wealth management products and Yu'e Bao have similar high-yield products. At present, a large number of banks have launched such products to help meet the needs of the times and prevent baby products from snatching bank customer resources and funds. 2. Integrate with internet finance. Nowadays, the Internet is very widespread, and banks must keep pace with the times and continue to develop. Although there are many bank wealth management products, they are basically the same. Except for slight differences in revenue, there is no innovation in general, and there will be no new product launches. As a result of the loss of market share, banks will not be eliminated unless they keep up with the times. ① At present, some banks have launched businesses similar to Yu'e Bao. For example, Ping An Bank has launched Ping An Ying, Bank of China's current account and so on. Targeted and even one-on-one launch of financial products that meet customer needs, improve services, and upgrade equipment. For example, it cooperates with e-commerce to launch wealth management products, strengthen publicity or develop mobile apps, and provide a series of convenient consulting and other services to adapt to this fast-paced society. 3. Lower the financial management threshold of banks. The high threshold and strict supervision of banks have greatly reduced the risk of wealth management, but have prevented small and medium investors from becoming their customers. Nowadays, SMEs account for an increasing proportion in the market, and their potential is also huge. Especially in recent years, the country has been emphasizing the development of SMEs. It can be seen that their status will become more and more important in the future. At present, there are also most individual investors who dare not try to manage money due to the high threshold of banks. Therefore, if banks want to develop better, they must take care of future "potential stocks". Therefore, banks must lower the threshold accordingly. Internet finance can use big data, cloud computing, etc. to obtain customer credit ratings through users' online consumption. Banks can cooperate with them to obtain a more complete credit rating system, a more comprehensive understanding of customers, and improve their own regulatory mechanisms. The threshold also ensures income and improves its recognition in society. The state can propose relevant policies according to the actual situation, implement relevant policies as needed, flexibly implement laws, regulations and policies, and make banks more competitive. From the above,
"Baby" wealth management products have also entered the bank, reducing the subscription amount, shortening the withdrawal time, attracting customers and funds, and are the products of Internet finance. The above products conform to the development of today's era. Banks have seen the inadequacies of traditional bank wealth management products and It is improving and making up for the shortcomings, but it is far from enough. (2) Improve service 1. Simplify the operation process. The cumbersome operation process makes everyone complain more about the bank's financial management. In this fast-paced era, people are racing against the clock Work and life, so the traditional bank wealth management business even has to go to the counter to queue for business, which is obviously not suitable for today's society. Banks can simplify some unnecessary operational processes. Not only that, but also can invite technical personnel to develop and use big data cloud computing Such advanced and mature technologies allow people to enjoy more complete services without leaving home. The simple operation process not only retains the original customer resources, saves staff time, but also allows older people to try financial management. Simple process makes them easier to learn To enhance the bank ’s goodwill among customers, gain recognition, and enhance the image of the bank. 2. Improve the banking wealth management business system. 2018 is called the first year of asset management, and the asset management industry is ushering in a period of unified supervision. The regulation establishes a unified Supervision standards to maximize fairness, greatly reduce the space for regulatory arbitrage, and promote the healthy development of asset management business. A good banking wealth management business system is a necessary condition to ensure low wealth management risks, and most people who manage wealth in banks are loyal to banks The perfect system has greater protection. Therefore, first of all, the bank can provide targeted services according to customer needs, establish a perfect and effective service evaluation system, implement the service to the ground, and change the traditional methods of telemarketing and SMS marketing. Establish a service system and customize wealth management products suitable for customers. If the bank continues to improve the business system, not only to ensure revenue, but also to innovate according to the development trend of the current era, it will greatly enhance the position of bank wealth management in people's hearts. Again, it is possible to develop bundling Sales strategy to drive banks Sales of wealth management products. Then, the bank will also strengthen the education of the staff, enrich itself, understand wealth management, take customers as the work center, and gain customer trust. According to statistics, the bank ’s fund sales platform has not been fully established, so the bank We also need to set up outlets to sell funds and other financial products. We have always been in a developing and advancing society, and we will not be eliminated by society only if we are more and more perfect and keep up with the pace of the times. The protection is mainly through strengthening the risk control of wealth management products. Although Internet financial wealth management products such as Yu'ebao have grown rapidly, the risk control is still very lacking. This is an important issue that people will consider when managing wealth, which is also making Internet finance wealth management. Most customers are the reason for small-capital wealth management. Internet financial wealth management products have been working on risk control in recent years to improve their competitiveness. To this end, banks must also improve themselves and maintain their advantages. Banks can introduce computers and financial proficiency. Of mixed talents Big data, cloud computing and other technologies for the regulation and control of financial risks, development and research related software and reduce risk. 4. Outlook for the future of commercial bank wealth management products Commercial bank wealth management products are affected to some extent by Internet financial wealth management products, diverting part of the customer funds of commercial bank wealth management products, and correspondingly taking away some potential customers of bank wealth management. The proportion of commercial wealth management products in market wealth management products forms an invisible pressure on the wealth management business of commercial banks. However, at the same time, we also found that the wealth management of commercial banks is much more mature than Internet finance, and cannot be completely replaced in wealth management products. The Tuandai.com incident reminded us that there are still major loopholes in our Internet financial platform, and the credit and professionalization are still lower than that of banks. It is easier for commercial banks to manage their wealth management. Although Internet financial management has strengthened risk monitoring, improved its credibility, and provided customers with protection, it is still inferior to banks in these aspects, and the most important thing for banks' human, material and financial resources is national protection. Internet financial management cannot be achieved for a long time. Faced with the development of technology, the influence of Internet financial wealth management products cannot be taken lightly, but as long as banks can keep up with the times, introduce talents, optimize the development of innovative financial wealth management products, enhance the weaker aspects related to the operational threshold, and improve risk supervision, etc. In terms of advantages, we continue to improve the short board and optimize the long board to enhance our competitiveness. We believe that bank wealth management products will still be in a leading position in the market. At present, the country is gradually regulating the development of Internet financial management. Its scale will not expand or may even decrease. The development speed will also slow down. From high speed to high quality development, this is undoubtedly a major benefit for banks According to the policy, banks should seize the opportunity to quickly develop their own wealth management business. I think that commercial bank wealth management products will not be completely replaced by Internet financial wealth management products, but if the banking system is not perfected, its share in the market will shrink severely. Constantly update the bank's wealth management products, integrate easy operation, low risk, high income and security, etc., and gain public recognition and establish its own image, so as to lead the trend of the wealth management era and not be eliminated by the times.
